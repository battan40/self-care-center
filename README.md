# Self Care Center

#### A Project that Reminds its Users of their Inherent value

  *Work on this project has slowed or come to a full stop. Deadline 2/21/21, 9pm MST.*

## Overview

  * This is a solo student project to begin to work with matching a comp utilizing `CSS`, `javaScript`, and `HTML`.  I was tasked to build an app that uses lists of mantras and affirmations to enhance their contemplative experience.


## Learning Goals

  * Write `HTML` and `CSS` to match a provided comp
  * Utilize *DRY* `javascript` create and access functionality
  * Understand how to listen to and respond to user events
  * Individualize my programming skill set
  * Lean into the beginning of understanding `localStorage`

## Setup

  * Create a repository and clone to your personal computer
  * Open in your text editor
  * Read the README.md
  * In terminal, run the command 'open index.html' to interact with the app

## Functionality Goals

  * At full functionality the user will be able to toggle between receiving a random message, saving that message and viewing all of their saved messages or delete.  

## Road Map

  * Ensure a user never sees a repeated message
  * Create a login page
  * Change the background dependent on what the USER selects
  * Add a loading animation
  * Add button hover growing button styles
  * Deeper error handling
  * Local Storage
